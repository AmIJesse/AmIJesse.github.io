### About Me

Hi, I'm Jesse, a journeyman electrician by trade and a cybersecurity enthusiast in my free time. While I spend my days working with circuits and electrical systems, my passion for technology has led me to explore the world of information security. Currently, I'm working towards earning my OSCP certification as I continue to expand my skills in penetration testing, ethical hacking, and other infosec topics.

This blog is a space where I document my journey, share insights, and discuss techniques I pick up along the way. Whether you're a fellow hobbyist or deep in the field, I hope you find something useful here. Thanks for stopping by!
